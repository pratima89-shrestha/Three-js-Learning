# Three-js-Learning
Three.js is a JavaScript library that simplifies creating 3D graphics in the browser using WebGL. It provides tools for rendering 3D scenes, objects, lighting, and animations efficiently.


This repository documents my journey of learning Three.js, a JavaScript library for creating 3D web graphics.

Topics Covered
Basics: Setting up a Three.js project, scene, camera, and renderer.
Objects: Creating and manipulating meshes (geometries + materials).
Lighting: Adding ambient, point, and directional lights.
Animations: Basics of animations and the animation loop.
Textures: Applying textures to objects.
Controls: Integrating user interactions (OrbitControls, DragControls).
Advanced: Loading external models, shaders, and physics.
